00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.950
They say Luis Miguel is the sun of Mexico.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.910
His voice had soft dawns, bright days and sunsets

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.470
golden.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.110
Today we are going to go through his vocal history as if

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.750
we followed the movement of the sun throughout life.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.670
If his voice ever gave you goosebumps or

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.750
you felt identified with his lyrics,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.430
stay.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.230
Today I'm going to show you how his voice changed.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.430
Because

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.230
and what we can learn from this change to sing better.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.150
Before starting this journey,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.750
subscribe, activate the bell and leave your

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.270
like.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.350
This is a channel for those who have respect for the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.230
artists.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.670
You sing... You laugh... You fly with Lau Valencia.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.350
The magic of getting started. With Lau Valencia

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.390
The magic is about to begin.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.190
Dawn already controlled the sun.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.230
With 11 years recording one plus one two lovers.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.350
Luis Miguel already showed some exceptional clean tuning,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.750
rhythmic security and clear emission for his age.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.110
It wasn't just childlike charisma, it was real control.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.058
Listen here:

00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:27.510
(music)

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.950
(music)

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.190
Its clean attack and projection are clear and frontal.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.430
Radiant morning.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.110
Fire in the chest.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.670
Between the ages of 14 and 16 on songs like Decídete,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.550
his chest voice begins to firm up.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.230
The highs are no longer an adventure,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.750
are your home.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.310
Youthful energy was the driving force,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.830
but there was technique, there was support.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.990
(music)

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.190
(music)

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.710
(music)

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.650
Here we perceive a firmer and more typical projection

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.850
brilliance in the vocals that will accompany him for decades.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.730
Midday Full balance in the sky.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.370
Between the 80s and 90s comes its golden period.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.850
The unconditional one.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.970
Entrégate.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.970
I have everything except you.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.170
Power and control at the service of emotion.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.650
This is where his phrasing becomes much more mature.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.930
(music)

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.930
(music)

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.170
(music)

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.970
(music)

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.130
(music)

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.570
Look, the vibrato control.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.570
And how he doesn't push, he doesn't scream,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.610
resonates.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.890
(music)

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.150
In this other video we can hear the handling of your air

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.790
in long sentences and the frontal opening of the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.190
vowels to maintain brightness.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.110
Dreamy dynamic golden afternoon.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.870
With the boleros of "Romance", "Second Romance",

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.550
etc. and his stage of Mexican music with the bikini.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.310
The King.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.190
If they let us, Luis Miguel does something that

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.590
many did not expect.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.990
He refines his technique, becomes more elegant,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.270
more aware of phrasing and color.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.430
In boleros his vibrato becomes finer,

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.790
the slur is more connected and the use of melismas and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.710
yacht ornaments typical of Mexican music,

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.230
but without excesses.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.630
Something that will also accompany him to this day.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.630
Technique put at the service of style.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.230
I hear here the slur and the slower vibrato,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.670
typical of the genre.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.700
(music)

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.339
In the bikini, for example.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.980
You can hear the change in color and ornamentation.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.780
(music)

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.540
This makes him more masculine, more serious,

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.460
more dramatic, somewhat darker.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.900
They are no longer those bright notes.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.540
Bright sunset.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.220
Today, at over 50 years old,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.060
adapts tonalities, relies on choirs and optimizes

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.300
resources, but still shows off his phrasing,

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.860
your control and your timing.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.620
It is not the same midday sun,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.780
It is the sunset sun.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.980
Intense, golden,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.900
sage.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.940
(music)

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.580
Notice here how the timbre became darker.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.260
And how he manages the air so as not to force his voice.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.820
(music)

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.780
(music)

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.260
(music)

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.860
(music)

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.740
(music)

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.380
(music)

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.620
He has nothing left to prove.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.100
Luis Miguel is the sun,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.460
so he gives himself the luxury of freeing himself.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.780
The pleasure of playing.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.230
(music)

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.820
Exercises.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.540
We will call the first exercise How delicious.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.500
Exercise one How.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.740
We will make a resounding m with our mouths closed,

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.460
the lips, palate and tongue

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.380
relaxed.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.180
We will choose a note within our spoken voice and do.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.686
Mmmm.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.820
If your lips itch, don't worry,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.780
is that the exercise is well done because we do not want a

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.780
tight mouth.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.450
Don't shout the sound, gone.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.930
Just thinking that you are watching something that you really like.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.220
Mmmm.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.570
Where?

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.730
If the exercise is done well.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.890
You'll feel it on your cheeks,

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.970
the nose and forehead.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.130
What we call a mask.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.130
So that?

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.650
This exercise serves to train the brightness of your voice

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.410
without tightening the throat, something that Luismi has been doing since

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.930
always.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.330
Exercise two.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.903
We will call this second exercise

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.596
the, the, the.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.610
As.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.666
First we will say the three spoken syllables:

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.033
the, the, the.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.290
Then we'll add a big smile.

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:03.486
LA, LA, LA.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.650
Now we will choose a comfortable note as before

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.443
in your spoken range.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.996
LA LA LA

00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:14.756
And now we'll add some Twang.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.730
It may sound a little nasal to you.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.463
Although it's not exactly that.

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:21.659
LA LA LA

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:23.659
nasal would be...

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:26.260
WORSE

00:07:26.393 --> 00:07:28.393
There is a subtle difference.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.220
Then we will repeat the same with the "E",

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.020
the "I", the "O" and the "U",

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.593
LA LA LA

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.313
THE THE THE

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.963
LI LI LI

00:07:40.963 --> 00:07:43.780
IT IT IT

00:07:43.823 --> 00:07:46.390
LU LU LU

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.460
What is this exercise for? To make your vowels sound better.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.180
clear and bright.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.940
Something very typical of Luis Miguel's style.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.820
Exercise three The third exercise that I propose to you is

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.460
of resistance and control.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.220
As?

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.300
First you are going to choose a phrase that you like,

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.420
such as Don't blame the sun that shines.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.860
Say it with a single exhalation,

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.180
without breathing in the middle and without falling out at the end.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.740
Do it as if you were telling a story.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.860
Don't blame the sun for shining, don't blame the sun for shining.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.540
Don't do it, don't blame the sun (breathe) that shines,

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.890
Don't blame the sun for shining.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:28.810
So that?

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.850
This exercise helps us learn to feel the support in

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.169
the diaphragm and not let out more air than we need.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.289
You can do this exercise with the phrase I gave you,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.450
with your favorite phrase or with a Luismi lyric.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.690
Just as the sun changes color throughout the day,

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.610
Our voice also changes throughout our lives.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.570
Luis Miguel shows us that changes should not be

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.330
scare us.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.970
You have to adapt, you have to shine differently,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.610
but always with technique.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.170
I am Valencia the singer, singing teacher,

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.930
announcer and vocal coach.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.330
Leave me in the comments what artist would you like to see?

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.250
Let's analyze the next one? And if this vocal journey to

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.450
through the life of Luis Miguel you liked,

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.490
Leave me your like, subscribe and follow me on the

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.330
networks for further analysis and vocal tools.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.290
See you on the next musical journey.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.850
(music)

00:09:25.433 --> 00:09:27.466
with Lau Valencia

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:29.466
the magic is about to begin
